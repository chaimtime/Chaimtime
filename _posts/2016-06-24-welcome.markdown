I started Chaimtime in 2002 as a blog. It was the new thing to do. Since then, I've stopped blogging, but I still need a place to showcase
things that I'm learning. I fully believe in social networking, but I like owning my content. I've been highly focused in Security, Parenting, Photography, and Education. For those topics, I feel longer
form thoughts should be blogged about.

As a learning experience, I've implemented a new content management system. This time I'm using Jekyll built on Ruby. Wordpress was way too
complicated for me. I'm tired of securing Wordpress, updating themes and plugins, and it is filled with javascript. The next few
entries will explain what went into all of this. 

For now, there is little to see, but I hope to populate the site with what I'm working on.
